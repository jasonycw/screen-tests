# What is this?
To simulate local dimming behavior

## ChatGPT Prompt

1. ```
   Give me an html page to simulate miniLED local dimming.
   I want the page to first let me set the row and columns and then display a completely black page with said row and column cell
   Then when mouse hover a cell that cell will turn white
   ```
   
2. ```
   Instead of inputting on the page, I want the row and column set by query string
   ```

3. ```
   There is only 1 row when I go with ?rows=10&columns=8
   ```

4. ```
   Now the table is rendered but it is not filling the whole screen
   ```
